classdef Block < handle
    %Block is a class representing each raw file and its corresponding
    %preprocessed file in data_folder and result_folder respectively.
    %   A Block contains the entire relevant information of each raw file
    %   and its corresponding preprocessed file.
    %   This information include a unique_name for each block, the name of
    %   the raw_file, its extension, its corresponding Subject, the prefix
    %   of the preprocessed file (for more info on the prefix look at the 
    %   docs), sampling rate of the corresponding project, list of channels
    %   that are chosen to be interpolated, rate of the preprocessed file
    %   given during the rating process in rating_gui, list of channels are
    %   interpolated during the preprocessing, list of channels that are
    %   interpolated by manual inspection and a boolean stating whether
    %   this block has been already interpolated or not.
    %
    %   Block is a subclass of handle, meaning it's a refrence to an
    %   object. Use accordingly.
    %
    %Block Methods:
    %   Block - To create a project following arguments must be given:
    %   myBlock = Block(subject, file_name, ext, dsrate)
    %   where subject is an instance of class Subject which specifies the
    %   Subject to which this block belongs, file_name is the name of the
    %   raw_file corresponding to this block and dsrate is the sampling
    %   rate of the corresponding project with which a reduced file is
    %   obtained.
    %
    %   update_rating_info_from_file_if_any - Check if any corresponding
    %   preprocessed file exists, if it's the case import the rating data
    %   to this block, initialise otherwise.
    %
    %   potential_result_address - Check in the result folder for a
    %   corresponding preprocessed file with any prefix that respects the
    %   standard pattern (See prefix).
    %   
    %   update_addresses - The method is to be called to update addresses
    %   in case the project is loaded from another operating system and may
    %   have a different path to the data_folder or result_folder. This can
    %   happen either because the data is on a server and the path to it is
    %   different on different systems, or simply if the project is loaded
    %   from a windows to a iOS or vice versa. The best practice is to call
    %   this method before accessing a block to make sure it's synchronised
    %   with its project.
    %
    %   setRatingInfoAndUpdate - This method must be called to set and
    %   update the new rating information of this block (For example when 
    %   user changes the rating within the rating_gui).
    %
    %   saveRatingsToFile - Save all rating information to the
    %   corresponding preprocessed file
